# Gestura ðŸ¤ŸðŸŽ¥

**Gestura** is a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) gesture recognition app that overlays live subtitles on a virtual camera, making video calls more accessible and inclusive.

The system uses a custom LSTM-CNN Attention-based model trained on a self-collected dataset, powered by MediaPipe landmark extraction.
